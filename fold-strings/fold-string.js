// function which takes a string of any length and turns each word inside out while keeping the order of the words intact.

// To turn a word inside out the internal letters will move out, and the external letters move toward the centre.

// If the word is even length, all letters will move.

// If the length is odd, you are expected to leave the 'middle' letter of the word where it is.

// Your function should also work for strings with spaces.

// Remember to start testing with the most basic cases when building up your test suite.
